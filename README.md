### Algorithm for the segmentation of prostate-specific membrane antigen labeling in ciruculating tumor cells of metastatic patients I designed and partially implemented (see also folder Wavelet Seeding Watershed Active Contour)

#### The patient blood samples analyzed were from clinical studies with IRB protocols 0804009740 and 0707009283 at Cornell Medicine

#### See examples of image processing of whole slides in folder Coverslip

##### Presentations and funding applications on this project are available here: https://researchgate.net/publication/374544332_Automated_Enumeration_and_Analysis_of_Circulating_Tumor_Cells_from_Peripheral_Blood_of_Metastatic_Cancer_Patients_for_Diagnosis_and_Refinement_of_Therapy_2012-2015

#### Applications to drug discovery in glioblastoma of these algorithms, I have presented here (see also the real-time analysis video of cells treated with araC above): https://researchgate.net/publication/374192982_Motion_Analysis_of_the_Nuclear_Epigenetic_Histone_Mark_H3K9me3_in_Live_Cells_Treated_with_ara-C_AT9283_and_Resminostat_for_Drug_Discovery_in_Glioblastoma_2017
