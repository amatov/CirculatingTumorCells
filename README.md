### Algorithm for the segmentation of prostate-specific membrane antigen labeling in ciruculating tumor cells of metastatic patients I designed and partially implemented (see also folder Wavelet Seeding Watershed Active Contour)

### The patient blood samples analyzed were from clinical studies with IRB protocols 0804009740 and 0707009283 at Cornell Medicine and NCT01718353 phase II clinical trial sponsored by Sanofi for early switch from Docetaxel to Cabazitaxel during the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer
