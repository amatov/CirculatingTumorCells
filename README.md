### Algorithm for the segmentation of prostate-specific membrane antigen labeling in ciruculating tumor cells of metastatic patients I designed and partially implemented (see also folder WaveletSeedingWatershedActiveContour)

#### The patient blood samples analyzed were from clinical studies with IRB protocols 0804009740 and 0707009283 at Cornell Medicine

#### See examples of image processing of whole slides in folder Coverslip
