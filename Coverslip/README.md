#### Matlab code for the analysis of cropped images of coverslip imaged at high resolution was written primarily by Shayan Modiri

#### C++ code for the analysis of whole coverslips imaged at low resolution was written by Nik Mihaylov (see two example images; see also the main folder for C++, executable, mex, ini, bat, and Matlab files)
