### I wrote a proposal, which was funded by the NIH, and did the initial Matlab script writing to analyze data and demonstrate a proof of principle 

#### Matlab code for the analysis of cropped images of coverslip imaged at high resolution was written primarily by Shayan Modiri of the University of Central Florida

#### C++ code for the analysis of whole coverslips imaged at low resolution was written, under my guidance, by Nik Mihaylov of Ubisoft (see two example images; see also the main path/folder for C++, executable, mex, ini, bat, and Matlab files)
